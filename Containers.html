<!-- Bootstrap: A free, open source CSS framework directed at reponses, mobile-first front end web development.
    It contains CSS and optionally JavaScript based design templates for typography, forms, buttons,
    navigation, and other interface components. -->

<!-- Grid System: Bootstrap grid is a powerful system for building mobile first layouts. It is a very 
    expensive with a great amount of options. -->

<!-- Bootstrap's grid sytem uses a series of tools, columns, layout, and aligned content. -->

<!-- Container: Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap website content and house a grid system. 
    **Without a container, the grid will not work properly**. -->

<!-- Row: rows create horizontal group of columns. Therefore, if you want to straight your layouts 
    horizontally, use .row. -->

<!-- Columns: Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns per page. We use .col-md-* to create a column,
    where * the number of columns between 1 - 12. md specifies the breakpoint where the columns change its width.
    md means "screen >= 768px". -->
<!-- How does it work: 1) Our grid supports 6 response breakpoints. Breakpoints are basd on min-width media queries,
    meaning they effect the breakpoint and all those involved (ex. col-sm-4 applies to sm, md, lg, xl, xxl). -->
